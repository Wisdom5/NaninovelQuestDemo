    Chinatsu: Oh, hello! I'm so glad someone finally came to help me.
    Chinatsu: I've been trying to move these boxes all day. We need to find a Mysterious Data Chip. It's said to contain secrets about this station. 
    Chinatsu: Honestly, I wouldn't mind keeping it for myself, but I promised Kohaku I'd help her find it. Maybe you'll want to keep it too?
    Chinatsu: Alright, time to get to work before I talk my way into overtime.

    Chinatsu: Wow, you did great! You're really strong and sharp. I knew I could count on you!
    Chinatsu: Even after sorting through all these boxes, I still can't find the Data Chip. Maybe it's in the Control Room. Could you go and check there for me?

    Sure, I'll check the Control Room.
    Alright, back to the map.

    It's so quiet here now...
    Looks like Chinatsu is gone. Guess Iâ€™ll have to handle the rest on my own.
    Alright, back to the map.
